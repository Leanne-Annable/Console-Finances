# Console-Finances

## Description 

This Is my attempt at using JavaScript to cycle through a stacked array and pull relevent information from it.
This allowed me to compare the data I pulled and give a report on the various information I found back to the user via the Console.


## Usage 

When opening the Webpage you need to right click, select inspect (alternatively press f12), then select the 'console' tab.

Here is a screen shot the webpage and console output side by side.

## Credits

I used stackoverflow and MDN for the main sources of information when i encountered issues with my code. I also discussed different methods with members of my class and TA's in regards to technique flow (verbal pseudocoding).
